Install:
Merge the Borderlands folder with your main borderlands folder \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Borderlands

Download FullDLCFastTravelHUB.rar from https://code.google.com/archive/p/s6fulldlcfasttravels/downloads

Navigate to SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Borderlands\WillowGame\CookedPC\Maps\Arid

Backup the file Arid_Arena_Coliseum_P

Rename "Mapslot6.umap" in the fast travel hub you downloaded to Arid_Arena_Coliseum_P and move it into the Arid folder

Now your fyrestone coliseum will be a fast way to get to dlc maps
