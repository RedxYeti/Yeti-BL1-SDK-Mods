added a button in the options to open the drop chances file
added a slider that lets you control the quality of drops, click its description for more info
fixed the reload key not putting you midway points in a few maps
fixed wayward pass and arid badlands robolution from being blackscreen after hitting the map reload key
fixed having to hit a trigger to spawn marcus in the arid badlands robolution


1.1.1:
made Hera's squad spawn right away instead of having to hit the trigger every time


1.1.0:
changed how loyalty coms drop so theyre no longer affected by manufacturer rarity
changed how hybrids drop
remember, you wont know if the hybrid is going to drop based on the weapon the boss is holding.
