This mod randomizes enemies across the game using the sdk. 

By default, small enemies will get randomized to small enemies, badasses to badasses and bosses to bosses, with a 1% for normal enemies  to randomize to a boss.

This mod is will not work with any Editable Basemaps mods.


Options:
Wandering Bosses: A percent chance of how often normal enemies are randomized to a boss. Starts at 1%. 0% to turn it off.


Static Bosses: Vanilla boss locations will be randomized to the same boss every time per save. Off by default, but I prefer it on.


Enemy Allegiance: With this on all the enemies join together to fight you. With this off they'll respect their vanilla allegiances.
On by default.


Strictness: Controls how strict the randomization is.

Strict means normal enemies replace normal enemies, and badasses replace badasses. (recommended)
Chaos Light means normal and badasses are mixed, bosses still only spawn bosses.
Full Chaos means normal, badasses and bosses have no restrictions.
